# GPUDeep_lanet_Ex
This code is run to detect lane using deep learning with GPU C++,
The code is test on MATLAB then extract by using GPU coder, and intergrated into NVIDIA C++ GPU 64x \n
THis code is used for Deep learning on GPU C++
The most important is how to configute cmake when running on NVIDIA emdedded board
